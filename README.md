# Information Retrival Search Engine

## Overview

The information retrieval search engine built by our team is based on Movies, the data for which has been obtained by the TMDB api. Our motivation for picking the above in order to build an information retrieval system is influenced by two main factors:  
- **Real world application**  
A typical Movie data consists of title, plot description, poster, genre, date, language, runtime, actors, review etc. that provides realistic paramteres for the construction of a typical search engine in real world. As a result, although set on Movie data, the search engine helps us draw parallels to many other forms of real world data.

- **Opportunity to learn**

### Crawling the data

1. How you crawled the corpus (e.g., source, keywords, API, library) and stored them (e.g., whether a record corresponds to a file or a line, meta information like publication date, author name, record ID)

2. What kind of information users might like to retrieve from your crawled corpus (i.e., applications), with example queries

3. The numbers of records, words, and types (i.e., unique words) in the corpus
