# Information Retrival Search Engine

## Overview

### Crawling the data

1. How you crawled the corpus (e.g., source, keywords, API, library) and stored them (e.g., whether a record corresponds to a file or a line, meta information like publication date, author name, record ID)

2. What kind of information users might like to retrieve from your crawled corpus (i.e., applications), with example queries

3. The numbers of records, words, and types (i.e., unique words) in the corpus
